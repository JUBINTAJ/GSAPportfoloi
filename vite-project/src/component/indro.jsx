    I'm a passionate frontend developer with a strong focus on building responsive and visually compelling web applications. I enjoy crafting clean, intuitive user interfaces and bringing designs to life using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Zustand, and Tailwind CSS. I'm always exploring modern frontend tools and techniques to create fast, accessible, and engaging digital experiences that work seamlessly across devices.

    On the backend side, I'm comfortable building robust APIs and managing databases using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Iâ€™ve worked with authentication systems, payment integrations like Razorpay, and RESTful service architecture to ensure smooth and secure data flow between client and server. With a full-stack mindset, I love delivering complete solutions from design to deployment, ensuring performance, security, and scalability throughout the stack.
